Tooling Category
Finding the right IDE that fits your coding workflow and requirements can often be frustrating. Many editors come close but stumble near the finish line. After years of searching, however, PhpStorm is the first editor that somehow manages to tick every requirement of mine. It's fast, feature-rich, incredibly customizable, and the new UI is gorgeous.
In this series, I hope you'll come along as I demonstrate, one episode at a time, my complete Laravel and PhpStorm workflow (including the incredible Laravel Idea plugin). So buckle up, there's a lot to cover!
